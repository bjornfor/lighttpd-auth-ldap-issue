This tree is for trying to find and fix the issue where

  lighttpd + ldap auth + git cloning via cgi script

fails with this message:

  (mod_authn_ldap.c.449) ldap: ldap_sasl_bind_s(): Can't contact LDAP server

This tree contains scripts to build and debug a local setup of lighttpd and
openldap.


== Initial setup

Clone and build openldap and lighttpd (fetches master branch):

  make init

The makefile depends on Nix (https://nixos.org/nix/) to setup build
environments.


== Debug cycles

In separate terminals, run:

  make openldap-run        # will start slapd with sudo to open port 389
  make lighttpd-run        # runs on port 1234 (unprivileged)
  make clone-repo-*        # run the various scenarios, the bug is in clone-repo-cgi-auth

After making changes to either lighttpd or openldap, run "make
{lighttpd,openldap}-build", then do "make *-run".

TIP: Run "tmuxp load ." to setup a suitable tmux session with pre-configured
panes. The config is in .tmuxp.yaml.


== Misc

To run openldap or lighttpd under gdb, uncomment LIGHTTPD_MAYBE_GDB,
OPENLDAP_MAYBE_GDB in the Makefile.

Setting debug level for libldap inside lighttpd gdb session:

    p ldap_int_global_options->ldo_debug
    set ldap_int_global_options->ldo_debug = 1

Other useful GDB commands:

  set detach-on-fork off

splot is broken in latest nixpkgs releases. Get it from nixpkgs-17.09:

  nix-env -iA haskellPackages.splot -f channel:nixos-17.09

Adding a delay (100ms) in lighttpd, before

  ret = ldap_sasl_bind_s(ld,dn,LDAP_SASL_SIMPLE,&creds,NULL,NULL,NULL);

"fixes" things. This can be done with gdb at runtime:

  break ldap_sasl_bind_s
  commands $number_from_break_command
  >call (int)usleep(1000*100)
  >cont
  >end
